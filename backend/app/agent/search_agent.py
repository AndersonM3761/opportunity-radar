Your job is to generate EXACTLY {len(categories)} highly specific Google Dork search queries, EXACTLY ONE for each category they selected.
Do NOT skip any selected category. If they selected Internship or Competition, you MUST generate a query for it.

CATEGORY-SPECIFIC QUERY RULES:
- HACKATHON queries: Search platforms like Unstop, Devpost, HackerEarth. Include both online and offline hackathons. Target 2026.
- INTERNSHIP queries: Search Internshala, LinkedIn Jobs, Unstop. Include the student's specific interests in the query. Target current openings.
- CERTIFICATION queries: Search Coursera, NPTEL, Google Cloud, AWS, Microsoft Learn. Find certifications that directly add value for their career goal.
- COMPETITION queries: Search Unstop, HackerEarth, Kaggle, CodeChef. Find coding/case/research competitions relevant to their branch.

IMPORTANT: Each query must include the student's specific interests (like "{interests}") — do NOT generate generic queries like "hackathon India 2026". Make them specific to this student's profile.

Target Indian sites where possible (e.g., site:internshala.com, site:unstop.com, site:devpost.com, site:hackerearth.com).

SOFT PREFERENCES (treat as nice-to-have, NOT deal-breakers):
{pref_context}

ALLOWED OPPORTUNITY TYPES: {allowed_types}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. ONLY return opportunities of type: {allowed_types}. Set `type` to exactly one of these.
2. Filter out opportunities that a {year} year student is NOT eligible for.
3. Filter out opportunities completely irrelevant to the student's branch and interests.
4. Preferences are SOFT — an amazing remote internship should NOT be rejected just because the student said "On-site". Include it and mention it's remote.
5. For certifications: these are almost always available online. Include any valuable certification relevant to their career goal.
6. Try to return at least 1 result per selected category if the search results contain it.

EVALUATOR FALLBACK MODE:
If fewer than 3 opportunities pass your strict filter above, 
switch to LENIENT mode: include any opportunity that is 
at least 50% relevant to the student's branch and interests. 
Always return a minimum of 3 results. If truly nothing exists,
return the 3 closest matches with a note explaining the partial match in the `reason` field.
Never return zero results.

TASK:
Review the verified search results above. Filter them down to the absolute best matches for this specific student's profile.
If a result is completely irrelevant or low quality, IGNORE IT.

HIGH-VALUE CRITERIA TO ENFORCE:
1. Hackathons & Competitions: Is there evidence of prestige, history (e.g. held every year), or significant presence/reliable hosts that have track records of pushing careers forward? If it looks like a low-effort or spammy hackathon, DROP IT.
2. Internships: Is it from a trustworthy, recognizable company? OR, if it's from a smaller startup, does the description prove it offers REAL value, mentorship, and tangible skill-building for their career path? (Since not everyone gets into FAANG, high-value startups are great, but cheap labor disguised as internships should be DROPPED).
3. Certifications: Only keep certifications that carry actual industry weight and respect.

If a result passes these strict checks, format it as a JSON object matching the OpportunityList schema.
- `description`: 2-3 sentences explaining what the program is, what participants do, eligibility, and what they gain.
- `reason`: ONE sentence connecting this to their specific {branch} background, {year} year status, and career goal. (Or explaining why it was included as a fallback match).

Return the valid opportunities formatted as a JSON list."""
